### 2. Why Binelek

**Purpose:** Differentiate from alternatives without naming competitors directly

**Sections:**

1. **Hero**
   - Headline: *"One platform. Not ten tabs."*
   - Subheadline: *"Most businesses juggle separate tools for tasks, dashboards, security, and market research. Binelek brings it all together."*
   - CTA: Schedule a Demo

2. **The Problem with Piecemeal Tools**

   | The Old Way | The Binelek Way |
   |-------------|-----------------|
   | Spreadsheets for tracking, another app for tasks, another for dashboards | Everything in one place |
   | Copy-paste data between tools | Automatic data sync |
   | Learn 5 different interfaces | One intuitive interface |
   | Pay for 5 different subscriptions | One predictable price |
   | No connection between tools | AI that sees your whole business |

3. **What Makes Binelek Different**

   - Visual: Screenshot of natural language query → instant answer

   **No Technical Setup**
   - *"Connect your tools in minutes, not days. No data engineers. No SQL queries. No consultants. Just connect and go."*

   - Visual: Comparison scale showing Binelek in the "sweet spot"

   **Security Included, Not Extra**
